### Generative Models

In this notebook we are going to cover two generative models for generating novel images:

1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
2. Generative adversarial networks (GANs)

Your main goal will be to retrain these models on a dataset of your choice and do some experiments on the learned latent space.

You should first copy this notebook and enable GPU runtime in 'Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware acceleration -> GPU **OR** TPU'.

### Dataset

This dataset is called [Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset). Here we will use a downsampled version of it (64x64x3) that will speed up all the experiments. [Download](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/LXBrnGGvUISlckW).

After downloading you should copy it to your google drive's main directory (or modify the code to load it from elsewhere).

After running the notebook on this default dataset you then need to find a dataset of your own."""

"""## 2.1. Introduction

The generative models that we are going to cover both have the following components:

1. A downsampling architecture (encoder in case of VAE, and discriminator in case of GAN) to either extract features from the data or model its distribution.
2. An upsampling architecture (decoder for VAE, generator for GAN) that will use some kind of latent vector to generate new samples that resemble the data that it was trained on.

Since we are going to be dealing with images, we are going to use convolutional networks for upsampling and downsampling, similar to what you see below.

Using these two basic building blocks we can now build a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE).

Even though it's not a generative model, CAE is a great way to illustrate how these two components (convolutional and deconvolutional networks) can be used together to reconstruct images.

You can view such model as a compression/dimensionality reduction method as each image gets compressed to a vector of 256 numbers by the encoder and gets decompressed back into an image using the decoder network.

## 2. 2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

<img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/vae-gaussian.png" width="500"> 

#### Encoder network
This defines the approximate posterior distribution, which takes as input an observation and outputs a set of parameters for specifying the conditional distribution of the latent representation. In this example, we simply model the distribution as a diagonal Gaussian, and the network outputs the mean and log-variance parameters of a factorized Gaussian. We output log-variance instead of the variance directly for numerical stability.

#### Decoder network
This defines the conditional distribution of the observation $z$, which takes a latent sample $z$ as input and outputs the parameters for a conditional distribution of the observation. We model the latent distribution prior  as a unit Gaussian.

#### Reparameterization trick
To generate a sample  for the decoder during training, we can sample from the latent distribution defined by the parameters outputted by the encoder, given an input observation $z$. However, this sampling operation creates a bottleneck because backpropagation cannot flow through a random node.

To address this, we use a reparameterization trick. In our example, we approximate  using the decoder parameters and another parameter  as follows:

$$z = \mu + \sigma\epsilon$$

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$  represent the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution respectively. They can be derived from the decoder output. The  can be thought of as a random noise used to maintain stochasticity of $z$. We generate  from a standard normal distribution.

The latent variable  is now generated by a function of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ which would enable the model to backpropagate gradients in the encoder through $\mu$ and $\sigma$ respectively, while maintaining stochasticity through $\epsilon$.

#### Implementation 

You can see how this trick is implemented below by creating a custom layer by sublassing tf.keras.layers.Layer.
It is then connected to the output of the original encoder architecture and an additional [KL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullbackâ€“Leibler_divergence) loss term is introduced.

## 2.3 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

### GAN architecture
Generative adversarial networks consist of two models: a generative model and a discriminative model.

**The discriminator** model is a classifier that determines whether a given image looks like a real image from the dataset or like an artificially created image. This is basically a binary classifier that will take the form of a normal convolutional neural network (CNN).
As an input this network will get samples both from the dataset that it is trained on and on the samples generated by the **generator**.

The **generator** model takes random input values (noise) and transforms them into images through a deconvolutional neural network.

Over the course of many training iterations, the weights and biases in the discriminator and the generator are trained through backpropagation. The discriminator learns to tell "real" images of handwritten digits apart from "fake" images created by the generator. At the same time, the generator uses feedback from the discriminator to learn how to produce convincing images that the discriminator can't distinguish from real images.
